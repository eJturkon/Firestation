Wildfire Ignition Cause Prediction:

Attempting to achive the highest level of accuracy in predicting ignition cause of wildfires throught the utilization of Application Programming Interfaces, only using
variables that can be easliy found for ease of implementing the models and thus calculating prbabilities of a wildfire being human or naturally ignited (model 1) and 
then if necessary the specific human ignition cause(model 2). The goal of this project was to develop of a tool that anyone can use that gives insight on not just when
to expect a wildfire but also what the cause would be in hopes of people being open to changing some behavior.
